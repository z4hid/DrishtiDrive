## DistriDrive Object detection using Yolov5 application

This is a Github repository for a Python application that uses YOLOv5 to perform object detection. YOLOv5 is an open-source package that comes with pre-trained models, so you can get started with object detection out of the box, or you can fine-tune it on your own dataset for custom object detection.

The application can be used to detect objects in real-time from a webcam or video file. It can also be used to fine-tune the model on a custom dataset.
